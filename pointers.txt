A pointer variable contains the memory address of another variable 

Pointers are declared using an asterisk: 
int* intPointer;



myMoney is a pointer - releasing the memory 

delete myMoney;


node& location = new node; 
location-> info = 7; 
location->next = listdata;
listdata = location;



listData->next = location; 
location->next = NULL;



try {
xxxxxxxxxxxxx
} catch (std::bad_alloc exception){

}

MakeEmpty must deallocate each node individually in order 

 
 delete ListData; 
 node* temp = listData; 
 listdata = listdata-> next;
 delete temp;

List Def 

Unsorted List: A list in which data items are placed in no particular order 

Sorted List: A list that is sorted by the keys of the list items; there is a semantic relationship among the keys  of the items in the list 

Key: The attributes used to determine the logical order of the list

Unsorted list: Operations: 
Constructor: may make empty list or take some initial elements
Transformers: PutItem, DeleteItem, MakeEmpty
Observers: IsFull, GetLength 
Iterators: ResetList, GetNextItem

Generic Data type 
A type for which the operations are defined bu the types of the items being manipulated are not defined

Our unsorted list adt simulates this by using a user-defined class called itemType that defines the member functions we need

Implementation level 

Array-based: Elments are stored sequentially in a contiguous chunk of memory 

Linked list-based: Elements are store in seperate nodes, connected by pointers

Using an array-based implementation for now




length =/ size 

length is how many elements are inside
size is the capacity 



Pointers

int* intPointer;
int alpha = 10;
intPointer = &alpha;


*intPointer = 25; //alpha is now 25

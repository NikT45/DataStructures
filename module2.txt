DATA DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

Data: Representation of information in a mnner suitable for communication or analysis by humans or machines 

ADT 
A data type whos (logical) properties are specified indepently of any particular implementation 


Basic ADT Operations 

Constructor - creates a new instance (object) of an ADT.

Transformer - changes state of one or more of the data values of an instance. 

Observer - allows use to observe the state of one or more of the data values without changing them. 

Iterator - allows us to process all the components in a data structure sequentially. 



Composite data types 

Structures and Unstructured 

Structured - arrays 

Unstructured - structs and classes



Arrays 
-  A one dimensional array is a structured composite type made up of a finite, fixed size collection of homogeneous (all of same data type) elements: 
- Contiguous collection of elements

In CPP 
arrays are always passed by reference - the array var is literally the address of the first obj
use const to protect the array from modification 



member selection operator (.)



Inheritance
new class = derived class
original existing class is the base class



try catch and throw 

the throw is inside of the try block 


Enum Variable 

Enum is a user defined data ype where we specify a set of values for a variable and the variable can only take on out of a small set of possible values. We use enum keyword to define a Enumeration.
